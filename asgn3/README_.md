cruzid: asoe

# Files:

  - httpserver.cpp
  - Makefile
  - WRITEUP.pdf
  - DESIGN.pdf
 
# How To Run:
To run type ./httpserver as well as the server ip/address and the port number. If you want a log file type -l followed by a name. If you want to allow caching use -c. Multithreading is disabled so typing -N followed by a thread number should lead to an error.
